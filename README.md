# Learning Polymer #

This is the repo created while learning [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) by following the awesome [Rob Dodson's polycast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsII5c3Mgw6fNYCzaWrsM3sMN).

I found that few polycasts were out dated because of the latest Polymer 1.0 version. So I have removed outdated version of code and replaced those with Iron Elements and Paper Elements based on [Polymer 1.0](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/)

## Install ##

1. Checkout the branch you are interested in
2. Install dependencies using bower:

`bower install`

## Run as ##

`polymer serve -H 0.0.0.0 -p 9090`

Then open browser: <http://0.0.0.0:9090/components/my-app/demo/index.html>
